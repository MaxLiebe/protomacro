# Proto Macro Keyboard by DIYCie

## Setup
Please refer to the manual on the [Wiki](https://wiki.proto.utwente.nl/members/workshops) to get instructions on how to build your keyboard and customize the software.

## Bootloader
Enter the bootloader in 3 ways:

* **Bootmagic reset**: Hold down the key at (0,0) in the matrix (usually the top left key or Escape) and plug in the keyboard
* **Physical reset button**: Briefly press the tiny black button on the PCB (if you have the enclosure in place already, use a thin pointy object to press it through the groove)
* **Keycode in layout**: Press the key mapped to `QK_BOOT` if it is available
